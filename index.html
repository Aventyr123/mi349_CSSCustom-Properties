    <p>CSS Custom Properties is very practical. You can declare a variable, assign it a value, and then reference it anywhere in the style sheet. You can reduce the repetitive code in the style sheet in this way.</p>
</section>
<section id = "two">
    <p>Variables must be declared in a declaration block. Here, the code uses the: root selector, then this variable can be used in the style of the entire page. The declaration of a variable, by itself, will not do anything until we refer to it in the code.</p>
